  licenseText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright ©\
    \ 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers\
    \ to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like\
    \ laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The\
    \ Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals\
    \ or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part\
    \ of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making\
    \ of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier\
    \ work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either\
    \ the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work\
    \ means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly\
    \ or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except\
    \ executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\
    \ copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\
    \ public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work\
    \ means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive\
    \ copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer\
    \ of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate\
    \ Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\
    \ feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the\
    \ user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties\
    \ are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how\
    \ to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands\
    \ or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\
    \n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the\
    \ work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form\
    \ of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\
    \ standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces\
    \ specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among\
    \ developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable\
    \ work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included\
    \ in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of\
    \ that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\
    \ Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation\
    \ is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this\
    \ context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)\
    \ of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,\
    \ or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to\
    \ run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all\
    \ the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run\
    \ the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.\
    \ However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose\
    \ tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing\
    \ those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding\
    \ Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
    \ the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms\
    \ that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\
    \ communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the\
    \ work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\
    \ automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding\
    \ Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\
    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on\
    \ the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This\
    \ License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.\
    \ The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the\
    \ output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges\
    \ your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\
    \nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\
    \ conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\
    \ covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\
    \ exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\
    \ provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\
    \ for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered\
    \ works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\
    \ control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted\
    \ material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances\
    \ is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed;\
    \ section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
    \ Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\
    \ under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\
    \ copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\
    \ restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work,\
    \ you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures\
    \ to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this\
    \ License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to\
    \ limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\
    \ the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey\
    \ verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\
    \ provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
    \ non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\
    \ intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a\
    \ copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or\
    \ no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey\
    \ a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,\
    \ in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also\
    \ meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work\
    \ must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License\
    \ and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement\
    \ in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n     c) You must license the entire\
    \ work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of\
    \ a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section\
    \ 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless\
    \ of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work\
    \ in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately\
    \ received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\
    \ display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces\
    \ that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them\
    \ do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
    \ works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which\
    \ are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation\
    \ and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\
    \ of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion\
    \ of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the\
    \ other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey\
    \ a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided\
    \ that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms\
    \ of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in,\
    \ or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),\
    \ accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\
    \ you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone\
    \ who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source\
    \ for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable\
    \ physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\
    \n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\
    \ offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\
    \ occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with\
    \ such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code\
    \ by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
    \ equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same\
    \ place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\
    \ subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code\
    \ is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\
    \ in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer\
    \ product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used\
    \ for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold\
    \ for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer\
    \ product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\
    \ product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or\
    \ common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular\
    \ user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or\
    \ is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless\
    \ of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer\
    \ uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\
    \n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,\
    \ authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified\
    \ versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its\
    \ Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\
    \ functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered\
    \ with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code\
    \ work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,\
    \ and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\
    \ and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\
    \ for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\
    \ But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains\
    \ the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,\
    \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation\
    \ Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\
    \ warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,\
    \ or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to\
    \ a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely\
    \ affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\
    \ communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation\
    \ Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\
    \ publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source\
    \ code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading\
    \ or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that\
    \ supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of\
    \ its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\
    \ shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\
    \ that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only\
    \ to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions,\
    \ but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the\
    \ additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may\
    \ at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any\
    \ part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal\
    \ in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions\
    \ on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give\
    \ appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\
    \ this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized\
    \ by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License\
    \ with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently\
    \ from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n     b) Requiring\
    \ preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in\
    \ that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing\
    \ it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\
    \ or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable\
    \ ways as different from the original version; or\n\n     d) Limiting the use\
    \ for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\
    \n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\
    \ names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f) Requiring indemnification\
    \ of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material\
    \ (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the\
    \ recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose\
    \ on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms\
    \ are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the\
    \ Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that\
    \ it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\
    \ you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction\
    \ but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered\
    \ work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that\
    \ the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,\
    \ in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply\
    \ to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of\
    \ a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered\
    \ work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
    \ your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the\
    \ same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\
    \ of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as\
    \ a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise\
    \ does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants\
    \ you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\
    \ copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating\
    \ a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10.\
    \ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered\
    \ work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,\
    \ to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\
    \ responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\
    An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization,\
    \ or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging\
    \ organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\
    \ each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\
    \ whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
    \ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has\
    \ it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.\
    \ For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\
    \ exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright\
    \ holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which\
    \ the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor\
    \ version”.\n\nA contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims\
    \ owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\
    \ acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,\
    \ of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims\
    \ that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the\
    \ contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the\
    \ right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
    \ royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\
    \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs,\
    \ a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,\
    \ not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\
    \ or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license\
    \ to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent\
    \ license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\
    \ to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly\
    \ available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either\
    \ (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive\
    \ yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)\
    \ arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\
    \ the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have\
    \ actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered\
    \ work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,\
    \ would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have\
    \ reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single\
    \ transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\
    \ of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\
    \ the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific\
    \ copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent\
    \ license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage,\
    \ prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more\
    \ of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not\
    \ convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party\
    \ that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\
    \ to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,\
    \ and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\
    \ the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\
    \ with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies),\
    \ or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations\
    \ that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or\
    \ that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this\
    \ License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other\
    \ defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable\
    \ patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed\
    \ on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\
    \ conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\
    \ License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\
    \ your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\
    \ as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\
    \ terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those\
    \ to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms\
    \ and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\
    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other\
    \ provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered\
    \ work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License\
    \ into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of\
    \ this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but\
    \ the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,\
    \ concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\
    \n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish\
    \ revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.\
    \ Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\
    \ differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given\
    \ a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered\
    \ version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to\
    \ it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\
    \ numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\
    \ If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the\
    \ GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance\
    \ of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\
    \nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,\
    \ no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a\
    \ result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\
    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\
    \ EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\
    \ PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR\
    \ IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\
    \ PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\
    \ YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16.\
    \ Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED\
    \ TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\
    \ CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING\
    \ ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\
    \ USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA\
    \ OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES\
    \ OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\
    \ HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
    \n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and\
    \ limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according\
    \ to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\
    \ an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless\
    \ a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return\
    \ for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n     <one line to give the program's name\
    \ and a brief idea of what it does.>\n     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\
    \n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it\
    \ under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
    \n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\
    \ ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\
    \ FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\
    \ with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add\
    \ information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program\
    \ does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts\
    \ in an interactive mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\
    \     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\
    \     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\
    \ conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w'\
    \ and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.\
    \ Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface,\
    \ you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the\
    \ program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow\
    \ the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License\
    \ does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your\
    \ program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking\
    \ proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use\
    \ the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please\
    \ read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

    \ copies\n      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n  \
    \  </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Preamble\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The GNU General\
    \ Public License is a free, copyleft\n      license for software and other kinds\
    \ of works.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The licenses for most software and other\
    \ practical works are designed to\n      take away your freedom to share and change\
    \ the works. By contrast, the GNU\n      General Public License is intended to\
    \ guarantee your freedom to share and\n      change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software\n      for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General\n      Public License for most of our software;\
    \ it applies also to any other work\n      released this way by its authors. You\
    \ can apply it to your programs, too.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      When we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n      price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n      have the freedom to\
    \ distribute copies of free software (and charge\n      for them if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it\n      if you want it, that you can\
    \ change the software or use pieces of\n      it in new free programs, and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      To protect your\
    \ rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n      these rights or asking\
    \ you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n      certain responsibilities\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or\n      if you modify it: responsibilities\
    \ to respect the freedom of others.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      For example, if\
    \ you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n      or for a fee,\
    \ you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n      you received.\
    \ You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n      source code.\
    \ And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    </p>\n\n\
    \    <p>\n      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n\
    \      (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n\
    \      giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n   \
    \ </p>\n\n    <p>\n      For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly\n      explains that there is no warranty for this free software.\
    \ For\n      both users&apos; and authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified\n\
    \      versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\n      not be\
    \ attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n\
    \      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\n\
    \      versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\n \
    \     do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\n \
    \     users&apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\n\
    \      such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\n   \
    \   which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\n   \
    \   designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n    \
    \  products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\n      we\
    \ stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\n      versions\
    \ of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n\
    \      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n\
    \      States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n  \
    \    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n  \
    \    to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n    \
    \  could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\n      assures\
    \ that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n    </p>\n\n  \
    \  <p>\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n      distribution\
    \ and modification follow.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\

    \ liable for\n          infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing\

    \    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n  \
    \        patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims,\n\

    \ not to\n          enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice\n\
    \          a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n    \
    \      &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an\n\

    \ the terms of this License, through\n          a publicly available network server\
    \ or other readily accessible\n          means, then you must either (1) cause\
    \ the Corresponding Source to\n          be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive\
    \ yourself of the benefit\n          of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in\n          a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License, to extend\n          the patent license to downstream recipients.\
    \ &quot;Knowingly relying&quot;\n          means you have actual knowledge that,\

    \ country, or your recipient&apos;s use of\n          the covered work in a country,\

    \ 3, 29 June 2007\n\n<<endOptional>>\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation,\
    \ Inc. <http<<beginOptional>>s<<endOptional>>://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"0.\"\
    ;match=\".{0,20}\">> Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of\
    \ the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like\
    \ laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \
    \ \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\
    \ Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may\
    \ be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from\
    \ or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"1.\";match=\"\
    .{0,20}\">> Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\
    \ form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either\
    \ is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\
    \ of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely\
    \ used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \"System Libraries\"\
    \ of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that\
    \ (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which\
    \ is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the\
    \ work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which\
    \ an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major\
    \ Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window\
    \ system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable\
    \ work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter\
    \ used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code\
    \ form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\
    \ work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\
    \ those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,\
    \ or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\
    \ unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.\
    \ For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated\
    \ with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and\
    \ dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\
    \ such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms\
    \ and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include\
    \ anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\
    \ Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\
    \ same work.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"2.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Basic\
    \ Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the\
    \ term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions\
    \ are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the\
    \ unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this\
    \ License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This\
    \ License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided\
    \ by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you\
    \ do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\
    \ in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\
    \ them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities\
    \ for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License\
    \ in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus\
    \ making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\
    \ under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any\
    \ copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\
    \   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\
    \ stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\
    \n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"3.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Protecting Users'\
    \ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed\
    \ part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling\
    \ obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\
    \ 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\
    \n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\
    \ rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim\
    \ any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\
    \ against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"4.\";match=\"\
    .{0,20}\">> Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive\
    \ terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices\
    \ of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License\
    \ along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each\
    \ copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a\
    \ fee.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"5.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Conveying\
    \ Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program,\
    \ or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code\
    \ under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"a)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> The work must\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant\
    \ date.\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"b)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> The\
    \ work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License\
    \ and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement\
    \ in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\"\
    ;original=\"c)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> You must license the entire work, as a whole,\
    \ under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License\
    \ will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,\
    \ to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.\
    \ This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it\
    \ does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n\
    \      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"d)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> If the work has\
    \ interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however,\
    \ if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal\
    \ Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered\
    \ work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature\
    \ extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to\
    \ form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,\
    \ is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are\
    \ not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond\
    \ what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\
    \ does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\
    \   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"6.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Conveying Non-Source\
    \ Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\
    \ of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding\
    \ Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n      <<var;name=\"\
    bullet\";original=\"a)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\

    \ for software interchange.\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"b)\";match=\"\
    .{0,20}\">> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\
    \ least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\
    \ support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code\
    \ either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\
    \ that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\
    \ performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"\
    c)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy\
    \ of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is\
    \ allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the\
    \ object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n      <<var;name=\"\
    bullet\";original=\"d)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Convey the object code by offering\
    \ access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent\
    \ access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at\
    \ no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"e)\";match=\"\
    .{0,20}\">> Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\
    \ inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work\
    \ are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\
    \   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from\
    \ the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\
    \ the object code work.\n\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\"\
    , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\
    \ family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
    \ into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful\
    \ cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received\
    \ by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of\
    \ that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of\
    \ the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\
    \ to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the\
    \ product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless\
    \ such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \"\
    Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization\
    \ keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions\
    \ of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\
    \ Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning\
    \ of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely\
    \ because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work\
    \ under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,\
    \ and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\
    \ and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\
    \ for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\
    \ But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains\
    \ the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,\
    \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation\
    \ Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\
    \ warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,\
    \ or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to\
    \ a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely\
    \ affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\
    \ communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation\
    \ Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\
    \ publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source\
    \ code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading\
    \ or copying.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"7.\";match=\".{0,20}\">>\
    \ Additional Terms.\n\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement\
    \ the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\
    \ additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions\
    \ may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify\
    \ the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\
    \ a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\
    \n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add\
    \ to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\
    \ supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\"\
    ;original=\"a)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability\
    \ differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n   \
    \   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"b)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Requiring preservation\
    \ of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material\
    \ or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n\
    \      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"c)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Prohibiting misrepresentation\
    \ of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such\
    \ material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version;\
    \ or\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"d)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Limiting\
    \ the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material;\
    \ or\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"e)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Declining\
    \ to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks,\
    \ or service marks; or\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"f)\";match=\"\
    .{0,20}\">> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material\
    \ by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual\
    \ assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual\
    \ assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other\
    \ non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within\
    \ the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of\
    \ it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with\
    \ a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license\
    \ document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\
    \ under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
    \ of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive\
    \ such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord\
    \ with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement\
    \ of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where\
    \ to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,\
    \ may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
    \ the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"\
    8.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a\
    \ covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
    \ your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights\
    \ under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received\
    \ copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated\
    \ and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for\
    \ the same material under section 10.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"\
    9.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You\
    \ are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of\
    \ the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence\
    \ of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\
    \ acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\
    \ propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\
    \ do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered\
    \ work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   <<var;name=\"\
    bullet\";original=\"10.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of\
    \ the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"11.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Patents.\n\
    \n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License\
    \ of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed\
    \ is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n   A contributor's \"\
    essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,\
    \ whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\
    \ manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor\
    \ version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence\
    \ of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\
    \ \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent\
    \ with the requirements of this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,\
    \ worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent\
    \ claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify\
    \ and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following\
    \ three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment,\
    \ however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission\
    \ to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"\
    grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment\
    \ not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work,\
    \ knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work\
    \ is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this\
    \ License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\
    \ means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,\
    \ or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for\
    \ this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly\
    \ relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,\
    \ your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the\
    \ covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in\
    \ that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to\
    \ or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate\
    \ by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some\
    \ of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,\
    \ modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\
    \ you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and\
    \ works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not\
    \ include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned\
    \ on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted\
    \ under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to\
    \ an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software,\
    \ under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your\
    \ activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any\
    \ of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\
    \ patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\
    \ you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection\
    \ with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless\
    \ you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior\
    \ to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding\
    \ or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise\
    \ be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\"\
    ;original=\"12.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n   If\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"13.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Use\
    \ with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other\
    \ provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered\
    \ work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License\
    \ into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of\
    \ this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but\
    \ the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,\
    \ concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\
    \n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"14.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Revised Versions\
    \ of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or\
    \ new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\
    \ will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
    \ address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing\
    \ version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of\
    \ the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have\
    \ the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may\
    \ choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If\
    \ the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU\
    \ General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance\
    \ of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\
    \n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\
    \ However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder\
    \ as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n   <<var;name=\"\

    \ PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\
    \ OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\

    \ END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\
    \nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\
    \ use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\
    \ which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach\
    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and\
    \ each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where\
    \ the full notice is found.\n\n<<var;name=\"description\";original=\"<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\";match=\".+\"\
    >>\n\nCopyright (C) <<var;name=\"copyright\";original=\"<year> <name of author>\"\
    ;match=\".+\">>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program. If not, see <http<<beginOptional>>s<<endOptional>>://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n\
    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this\
    \ when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name\
    \ of author>\n\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\
    \ `show w'.\n\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under\
    \ certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands\
    \ `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public\
    \ License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface,\
    \ you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you\
    \ work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
    \ for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply\
    \ and follow the GNU GPL, see <http<<beginOptional>>s<<endOptional>>://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <http<<beginOptional>>s<<endOptional>>:\
    \ <<var;name=\"philicenses\";original=\"//www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\"\
