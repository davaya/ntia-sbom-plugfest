Notes from SBOM generation:

- Each of the attached were automated detections from Black Duck by pointing at the files provided (tar.gz file for time, .c file for zephyr, git repo for node-thinkster, and single file for blinky.ex)
- Blinky sample was not detected, although could have been added either by scanning the top-level project OR as manual component if required - we chose not to do this


Black Duck includes many other data fields for each component. 
The exporter can be easily modified to include any of these on demand. 

Some examples of information not included, but could be added:

- How was the component detected? File signature, package manager, etc
- Was this a detected component, or a manually added one? (e.g. COTS or in-house development)
- Was the component modified or used in its original form?
- Metadata fields from OpenHub.net - package supplier, originator, etc.
- Custom metadata field entries provided by the user
- Comments made whilst reviewing components


If you are trying to import the SBOM and would find any of these useful, please let us know.
